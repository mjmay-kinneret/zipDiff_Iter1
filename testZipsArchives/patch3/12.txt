Lecture 1:
Information retrieval (IR) is the activity of obtaining information resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources. Searches can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for metadata that describe data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds. (Wikipedia)
What the system should be able to tell us is, given a query, IR should be able to tell us what the relevant information is, or if it does or does not exists.
IR is focused mainly on text and queries that are entered by the user.

The IR process:
1.	We start with the user that has an information need. The goal of the user is to download a version of Mac OS X (for example), he writes it as a query for a search engine.
2.	The query goes to the search engine with a DB, and the search engine gets the results, scores and ranks them according to what’s more relevant and what’s less.
3.	We return results to the user ranked and sorted according to relevance. Dwell time, mouse movements give the backend feedback on how well their information they retrieved is.
4.	The user accesses the information.
All this should happen in a sub second.
